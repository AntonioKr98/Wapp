		<p>Bojan Bogdanovic signing a 4 year, $72 million dollar contract in the 2019 offseason was the biggest free agent signing in team history. This was a guy who was in the middle of his prime at 30 years old, coming off a season where he was promoted to the Pacer’s number one option for more than half the season due to Victor Oladipo’s unfortunate career-altering knee injury. Bojan lead the team to a 48-34 record, good enough for 5th seed in the Eastern Conference, a year after pushing the last Lebron Cavaliers team to 7 games in the first round. Bojan agreeing to come be the third or potentially even fourth option at a relatively team-friendly price was a such a positively shocking outcome for a team that whiffed on both Nikola Mirotic (went back to Europe) and Tobias Harris (signed in Philly for a max contract). Bogdanovic was not in that place earlier this season. As he worked himself back from the wrist surgery that ended his season in May, Bogdanovic struggled to find his form at times. It 			appears he 			has found his touch just in time for the Jazz, helping his squad stay atop the West even with Donovan Mitchell (right ankle) sidelined, and playing his best ball with the playoffs approaching. Mitchell and Jamal Murray, the stars of last season’s spectacular first-round showdown between Denver and Utah, were both missing due to injury Friday. Mitchell’s absence, though, has afforded Bogdanovic an opportunity to shoulder more offensive duties, helping him play his way through his early-season issues.
		“I’m just trying to be aggressive. They need me to score more without, especially, Donovan,” Bogdanovic said this week. “I would love to have him back on the floor with us. With him out, I know I’m going to have more shots than I used to have this season. So I can be a little bit patient. I don’t have to hunt my shot and take bad shots. So I’m playing kind of relaxed and it’s good for me to get my confidence back and be ready for the playoffs. “He’s had many of those games, but obviously tonight was the biggest one,” All-Star center Rudy Gobert said. “He’s been playing amazing for us. He’s a big reason why we’ve been winning, four in a row. Tonight, was a big game and he stepped up big time.”
		What did Jazz head coach Quin Snyder see from the sharpshooting Croatian? “It’s what didn’t we see from him tonight,” Snyder said. “He was making great reads. He really scored every way possible: stuff in transition, catch-and-shoot 3s, off the dribble. And even late when they started to blitz him, he found Rudy [Gobert] a couple of times, which says a lot when you have it going the way he does. He’s just being aggressive and he’s in a great place mentally.”</p>
